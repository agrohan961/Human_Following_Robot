About this project:
For the past one month I have been learning the basics of electronics as well as how to use Arduino Uno and various sensors along with it. Now that my basics were clear it was time to make a project. I started by using the in-built serial monitor in the IDE to pass commands to the Arduino, then it was time to make it autonomous. I used ultrasonic sensor and IR sensors to detect the object it should follow.

Steps to make this project:
1. Gather components like Arduino, Dc geared motors with wheels, IR sensors, ultrasonic sensor, motor driver shield, battery 9 v, Jumper wires etc.
2. Take metal chasis and place 2 motors with wheels along with castor wheel on it to make a car.
3. Place IR sensors on the car, 2 on the front facing right and left and 1 on the back.
4. Place ultrasonic sensor to on the front of the car.
5. Connect arduino and motor driver on car.
6. Do connections accordingly.
7. Upload the code and connect with battery.

Adjust the sensitivity of IR sensors.

Your project is ready...!!!
